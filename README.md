# Scrolliosis

Scrolliosis is an open-source Android app that helps you reclaim focus by blocking distracting apps behind a knowledge gate. Instead of scrolling mindlessly, you must answer a question from your personal Knowledge Vault before any blocked app is allowed to open - for a limited time window only.

---

## Features

- **App blocking** — select any installed app to block via an Accessibility Service
- **Knowledge Vault** — store your own questions & answers; one must be answered correctly to unlock a blocked app for 5 minutes
- **Overlay enforcement** — a full-screen overlay immediately appears when a blocked app is launched
- **GateKeeper mode** — configure blocking schedules and rules
- **System Purge** — quickly clear all entries from the vault
- **Onboarding** — guided step-by-step permission setup (Overlay, Accessibility, battery optimisation)
- **Boot persistence** — the service restores itself after a device reboot
- **Manufacturer workarounds** — auto-detects OEM battery-saver restrictions (Xiaomi, Huawei, Samsung, etc.) and prompts the correct settings screen

## Building

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11 (e.g. [Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/))
- Android SDK with API 35 platform installed

### Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scrolliosis.git
cd Scrolliosis
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug          # Linux / macOS
gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug        # Windows
```

The debug APK lands at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

### Tests

```bash
./gradlew test                        # JVM unit tests (Robolectric)
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest        # Instrumented tests (requires device / emulator)
```

## Release signing

Signing credentials are **never** stored in the repository. For local release builds, add the following to `local.properties` (gitignored):

```properties
# Path is relative to the project root directory
SIGNING_STORE_FILE=../key/key
SIGNING_STORE_PASSWORD=<your-store-password>
SIGNING_KEY_ALIAS=<your-key-alias>
SIGNING_KEY_PASSWORD=<your-key-password>
```

> The store file path can be absolute or relative to the project root. The file itself must stay **outside** the repository directory.

CI uses GitHub Actions secrets — see [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml).
